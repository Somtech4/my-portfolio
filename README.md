# Security Engineering & Detection

Hi, I’m Joshua Eze — a Security Engineer focused on detection engineering, SIEM operations, and cloud security.

I approach security as a systems problem, not a checklist.

My work centers on *why detections fail*, *how identity and governance controls reduce blast radius*, and *where engineering trade-offs shape analyst behavior in real SOC environments*. I design practical, auditable security controls that improve signal quality, reduce alert fatigue, and support effective incident response.

My projects sit at the intersection of security operations, engineering, and risk, with an emphasis on clarity, operational realism, and decision-making under uncertainty.


## How to Explore My Work

- **Start here:** ML-Enhanced Threat Detection — end-to-end detection engineering with SIEM integration  
- **SOC content:** Microsoft Sentinel labs for real-world detection, hunting, and response workflows  
- **Engineering discipline:** Review commit history, documentation, and testing approach  



## Featured Security Engineering Projects

### SIEM: ML-Enhanced Threat Detection  
https://github.com/Somtech4/machine-learning-threat-detection

**Objective**  
Reduce SOC alert fatigue and improve detection fidelity by augmenting traditional SIEM workflows with machine-learning-based threat scoring — without replacing analyst judgment or existing SIEM tooling.

**Engineering Stack**  
Python · Scikit-learn (Random Forest) · FastAPI · Splunk (HEC) · Threat Intelligence

**What I Built**
- Feature-engineered ML models for brute-force, DDoS, and web attack detection  
- Real-time scoring pipeline integrated into Splunk ingestion workflows  
- API-driven architecture designed for SOC automation and extension  

**Why This Matters**
This project demonstrates how ML can **support analyst decision-making**, not overwhelm it — prioritizing high-confidence alerts while preserving explainability and auditability.



### Microsoft Sentinel Security Operations Lab  
https://github.com/Somtech4/sentinel-threat-hunting

**Objective**  
Build reusable detection, hunting, and response content for cloud-native SOCs, grounded in consistency, auditability, and risk-based triage.

**Engineering Stack**  
Azure Sentinel · KQL · Microsoft Defender · SOAR Concepts

**What I Built**
- Custom analytic rules aligned to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Threat hunting queries and investigation workflows  
- Documented incident response playbooks for SOC handover  

**Why This Matters**
Provides a practical blueprint for **structured, cost-effective SOC operations** in Azure — emphasizing signal quality, repeatability, and operational clarity over alert volume.



### Identity Governance & Privileged Access Reviews (Lab 2)

**Objective**  
Demonstrate identity governance controls using Microsoft Entra ID Access Reviews to reduce standing privilege and support least-privilege enforcement in cloud SOC environments.

**What I Implemented**
- Privileged group access reviews scoped to high-risk identities  
- Review configuration aligned to governance and audit requirements  
- Analysis of operational trade-offs (review cadence vs analyst overhead)  

**Why This Matters**
Identity governance acts as a **preventive detection control**.  
Reducing long-lived privilege lowers blast radius *before* alerts ever fire — a foundational security engineering principle.



### Enterprise Vulnerability Management & Reporting (In Progress)  
https://github.com/Somtech4/Soclab1

**Objective**  
Simulate an end-to-end enterprise vulnerability management lifecycle — from scanning to executive-level reporting.

**Engineering Stack**  
Qualys · Python · PowerShell · Jira · Risk Frameworks

**What I’m Building**
- Automated vulnerability scanning and validation workflows  
- Risk-based prioritization aligned to business impact  
- Clear, executive-level reporting to support remediation decisions  

**Why This Matters**
Demonstrates the ability to **translate technical findings into actionable risk insights**, reflecting real-world enterprise vulnerability management practices.
