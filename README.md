Security Engineering & Detection
Hi, I’m Joshua Eze — a Security Engineer with hands-on experience in detection engineering, SIEM operations, and cloud security. I focus on building practical, automated security controls that reduce alert fatigue, improve detection quality, and support effective incident response in modern SOC environments.
My work sits at the intersection of security operations, engineering, and risk, with a strong emphasis on clarity, auditability, and real-world impact.

 How to Explore My Work
 Start here: ML Threat Detection project — end-to-end detection engineering with SIEM integration
 SOC content: Microsoft Sentinel lab for real-world detection & response workflows
 Engineering discipline: Review commit history, documentation, and testing approach

 Featured Security Engineering Projects
 Next-Gen SIEM: ML-Enhanced Threat Detection
 https://github.com/Somtech4/machine-learning-threat-detection
Objective Reduce SOC alert fatigue and improve detection fidelity by augmenting traditional SIEM workflows with machine-learning-based threat scoring.
Engineering Stack Python · Scikit-learn (Random Forest) · FastAPI · Splunk (HEC) · Threat Intelligence
What I Built
 Feature-engineered ML models for brute-force, DDoS, and web attack detection
 Real-time scoring pipeline integrated into Splunk ingestion workflows
 API-driven architecture suitable for SOC automation and extension
Impact
 Demonstrates how ML can support analysts by prioritizing high-confidence alerts
 Shows a practical approach to improving MTTD without replacing existing SIEM tools

 Microsoft Sentinel Security Operations Lab
 https://github.com/Somtech4/sentinel-threat-hunting
Objective Build reusable detection, hunting, and response content for cloud-native SOCs.
Engineering Stack Azure Sentinel · KQL · Microsoft Defender · SOAR Concepts

What I Built
 Custom analytic rules aligned to MITRE ATT&CK
 Threat hunting queries and investigation workflows
 Documented incident response playbooks for SOC handover 
 
 Impact
 Provides a blueprint for cost-effective, structured SOC operations in Azure
 Emphasizes consistency, auditability, and risk-based triage

 Enterprise Vulnerability Management & Reporting (In Progress)
 https://github.com/Somtech4/Soclab1
Objective Simulate an end-to-end vulnerability management lifecycle — from scanning to executive reporting.
Engineering Stack Qualys · Python · PowerShell · Jira · Risk Frameworks

What I’m Building
Automated vulnerability scanning and validation workflows
Risk-based prioritization aligned to business impact
Clear, executive-level reporting to support remediation decisions

Impact
 Demonstrates ability to translate technical findings into actionable risk insights
 Reflects real-world enterprise vulnerability management practices
