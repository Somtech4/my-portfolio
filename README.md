# 🛡️ Security Architecture & Threat Intelligence

**Hi, I'm Joshua Eze.** I architect intelligent security systems and automate defense at scale. I focus on translating business risk into resilient cloud security controls, with measurable results in reducing incident impact and operational overhead.

**📍 Currently:** Actively exploring Security Engineering & Cloud Security roles in the UK, Ireland, and Canada (eligible for visa sponsorship).

## 🔬 Featured Research & Engineering Projects

### [Next-Gen SIEM: Production ML Threat Detection](https://github.com/Somtech4/machine-learning-threat-detection)
**Objective:** To solve SOC alert fatigue and improve threat recall by augmenting traditional SIEMs with a real-time ML scoring engine.
- **Engineering Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn (Random Forest), FastAPI, ngrok, Splunk HEC.
- **Key Results:** Achieved **2.24% false positive rate** and **93.7% attack recall** across DDoS, brute force, and web attack simulations.
- **Business Impact:** Demonstrates a production-ready approach to reducing analyst burnout and accelerating mean time to detect (MTTD) through automation.

### [Microsoft Sentinel Security Operations Lab](https://github.com/Somtech4/sentinel-threat-hunting)
**Objective:** To build and document reusable, efficient security content for cloud-native SOCs.
- **Engineering Stack:** KQL, Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, SOAR concepts.
- **Key Results:** Developed a repository of custom detection rules, hunting queries, and incident response playbooks.
- **Business Impact:** Provides a blueprint for implementing cost-effective, automated threat detection and response in Azure environments.

### [Enterprise Vulnerability Management & Reporting](https://github.com/Somtech4/Soclab1) (SocLab1)
**Objective:** To emulate and streamline the risk-based vulnerability management lifecycle from assessment to executive reporting.
- **Engineering Stack:** Qualys, Jira, Python for automation, PowerShell.
- **Key Results:** Automated scanning workflows and authored board-level risk reports that influenced remediation priorities.
- **Business Impact:** Shows ability to bridge technical findings with business risk, a critical skill for enterprise security programs.
